# Finance Tracker
A web application I made for tracking basic income and expenses. It also has a statistics page which displays the amount of money spent on each category with a Chart. Everything gets added and saved to localstorage.

## What I used in this project
* Vue.js
* vue-toastification
* Sass
* [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)

## Why I decided to build this app
This is my first time using the Composition API in Vue, I wanted to familiarize myself with how things work differently and found out I prefer the Composition API A LOT over the Options API. I chose to create a finance tracker because I thought it would be an interesting project to try out all the changes.

## Things I want to add in the future
* Sorting of the expenses by date
* A better way to choose expenses and income with more options
* ~~A bar chart on the statistics page which displays each expense category compared to the total expenses amount~~
* Ways to see and add more in-depth data
